- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Eva. I'm a **Chemical Engineer** who fell in love with the wonderfull world of **Data Science**.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m still learning and making my way into this world but, in time, I think I would be able to get the most out of the combination of my knowledge on these two areas.
  
  The Chemical Engineering Degree has taught me the basics of this industry and my work experience in the lab has helped me improve not only my technical habilities but also my analytical skills.
  However, I got to this point where you want to know more. I want to be able to develop a better way to process all the data generated during the tests. I want to create good prediction models for the different datasets. And I want to optimize processes in order to make life easier for other workers, including myself. 
- ðŸ“« There's more information about me in my **LinkedIn profile**, feel free to take a look: https://www.linkedin.com/in/eva-iglesias-vieito-ingeniera-quimica/
